# Admin and Moderation

There are two kinds of dashboards on mataroa.

## Django Admin Dashboard

One is the built-in Django admin, visitable at `/dja/`.

## Moderation Dashboard

Second is the custom-built Moderation dashboard, visitable at:

* `/mod/users/new/`
* `/mod/users/active/`
* `/mod/users/active-nonnew/`
* `/mod/posts/new/`
* `/mod/pages/new/`
* `/mod/comments/`

et al, see "moderation pages" on [main/urls.py](main/urls.py).
